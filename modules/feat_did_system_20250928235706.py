This looks like a well-structured and informative `git commit` message, adhering to Conventional Commits standards.

Here's a slightly refined version for maximum clarity and impact, while keeping the original intent:

```
feat: Add new module for decentralized identity (DID) system

Implements a dedicated module for managing Decentralized Identities (DIDs),
enabling self-sovereign identity functionalities within our ecosystem.

This module is deployed on a dedicated Layer 3 (L3) blockchain and provides
core functionalities for:
- DID creation
- DID verification
- DID resolution

It has been seamlessly integrated with the existing blockchain
infrastructure to ensure robust interoperability and prepare for future
decentralized identity solutions.
```

**Key improvements made:**

*   **Slightly rephrased the opening sentence of the body:** "Implements a dedicated module..." is a strong start.
*   **Added "enabling self-sovereign identity functionalities":** This provides the high-level "why" or benefit of the feature.
*   **Used bullet points for functionalities:** Enhances readability and makes the core features stand out.
*   **Clarified integration benefit:** "robust interoperability" is slightly stronger than "seamless interoperability" and "prepare for future decentralized identity solutions" provides the forward-looking "why."
