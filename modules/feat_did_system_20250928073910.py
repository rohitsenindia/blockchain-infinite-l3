### Current (Good)

```
feat: Add new module for decentralized identity (DID) system

- Implemented a module for a decentralized identity (DID) system on a dedicated Layer 3 (L3) blockchain.
- The module includes functionalities for DID creation, verification, and resolution.
- Integrated with existing blockchain infrastructure to ensure seamless interoperability.
```

### Option 1: Improved Clarity and Impact

This version adds a bit more context and emphasizes the benefits.

```
feat: Introduce Decentralized Identity (DID) System Module on L3

This commit delivers a new, foundational module implementing a Decentralized Identity (DID) system, specifically engineered and deployed on a dedicated Layer 3 (L3) blockchain.

Key functionalities provided by this module include:
- **Comprehensive DID Lifecycle Management:** Enabling secure creation, robust verification, and efficient resolution of DIDs, aligning with W3C DID specifications.
- **Dedicated L3 Architecture:** Leveraging a dedicated Layer 3 blockchain to provide an environment optimized for scalability, performance, and privacy essential for identity management.
- **Seamless Interoperability:** Integrated with existing Layer 1/2 blockchain infrastructure and communication protocols to facilitate secure and verifiable identity interactions across our broader ecosystem.

This addition significantly advances our platform's capabilities by enabling the development of applications that leverage verifiable credentials and self-sovereign identity, fostering greater trust, data control, and user empowerment.
```

**Key changes and why:**
*   **Subject:** Slightly rephrased for a stronger verb "Introduce" and more concise "on L3".
*   **Opening:** Added a sentence to set the stage and emphasize its "foundational" nature.
*   **Bullet Points:**
    *   Made more descriptive (e.g., "Comprehensive DID Lifecycle Management").
    *   Added a hint about W3C standards (if applicable, which is common for DIDs).
    *   Expanded on the "why L3" (scalability, performance, privacy).
    *   Specified "Layer 1/2" for existing infrastructure to be more concrete.
*   **Closing Paragraph:** Added a paragraph explaining the strategic value and impact of this feature.

### Option 2: More Concise, but still Enhanced

If you prefer to keep it shorter but still want to add a bit more punch.

```
feat: Implement DID system module on dedicated L3

- Introduced a core module for a Decentralized Identity (DID) system, leveraging a dedicated Layer 3 (L3) blockchain for optimal performance and scalability.
- Provides full DID lifecycle support, including creation, robust verification, and efficient resolution capabilities.
- Integrated seamlessly with existing blockchain infrastructure, enabling cross-ecosystem identity interoperability and secure verifiable interactions.

This lays the groundwork for self-sovereign identities within our platform.
