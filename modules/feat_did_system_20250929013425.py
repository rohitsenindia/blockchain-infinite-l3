feat: Implement Decentralized Identity (DID) on Layer 3

This commit introduces a new module for managing Decentralized Identities (DIDs) on a dedicated Layer 3 (L3) blockchain.

Key functionalities include:
- **DID Creation:** Allows for the generation and registration of new DIDs on the L3 network.
- **DID Verification:** Supports the cryptographic verification of DID credentials and proofs.
- **DID Resolution:** Enables the lookup and retrieval of DID documents from the L3 network.

Integrated with existing blockchain infrastructure to ensure seamless interoperability and facilitate broader adoption of decentralized identities within our ecosystem.
```

**Reasoning for changes:**

*   **Subject line:** Slightly rephrased to be more active and direct: "Implement Decentralized Identity (DID) on Layer 3".
*   **Opening sentence:** Added a brief introductory sentence ("This commit introduces...") to set the context before the bullet points, which is a common practice for good commit messages.
*   **Enhanced Bullet Points:**
    *   Kept your original points but made them slightly more descriptive and actionable.
    *   Used bolding for the functionality names (`**DID Creation:**`) for better readability.
    *   Added a bit more detail to each functionality, e.g., "on the L3 network" for creation, and "from the L3 network" for resolution.
*   **Last sentence:** Combined the integration aspect with its strategic benefit ("facilitate broader adoption of decentralized identities within our ecosystem"), making the purpose even clearer.

This version maintains conciseness while providing a bit more depth and structure, making it even more valuable for future reference.
