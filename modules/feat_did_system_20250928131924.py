This is a great, concise description of a significant feature! To make it even more impactful and clear, especially for a release note or a feature announcement, you could expand on the benefits and add a touch more detail.

Here are a few options, ranging from slightly enhanced to more detailed:

---

### Option 1: Slightly Enhanced (Focus on benefits)

**feat: Introduce Decentralized Identity (DID) System Module on Layer 3**

*   Launched a new core module for a Decentralized Identity (DID) system, purpose-built for our dedicated Layer 3 (L3) blockchain.
*   This module empowers users and applications with self-sovereign identity capabilities through:
    *   **DID Creation:** Securely generate and register unique DIDs on-chain.
    *   **DID Resolution:** Efficiently retrieve DID Documents to discover public keys and service endpoints.
    *   **DID Verification:** Authenticate the integrity and ownership of DIDs.
*   Seamlessly integrated with existing blockchain infrastructure to ensure robust interoperability and lay the foundation for advanced identity solutions.

### Option 2: More Detailed (Adding "Why" and future-proofing)

**feat: New Module for Decentralized Identity (DID) System on Layer 3 Blockchain**

We are thrilled to announce the deployment of a new, foundational module for a Decentralized Identity (DID) system, specifically engineered for our dedicated Layer 3 (L3) blockchain. This advancement significantly enhances our platform's capabilities for digital identity management.

**Key Features:**

*   **DID Creation:** Users can now generate and register unique, self-sovereign Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) directly and securely on the L3 blockchain.
*   **DID Resolution:** Implemented robust mechanisms for resolving DIDs, allowing for the efficient retrieval of DID Documents which contain associated public keys, service endpoints, and other cryptographic material.
*   **DID Verification:** Provides comprehensive functionalities to verify the authenticity and integrity of DIDs, crucial for trustless interactions and secure transactions.

**Integration & Benefits:**

*   **Dedicated L3 Performance:** Leveraging our L3 architecture ensures optimal performance, scalability, and dedicated resources for identity operations, crucial for a secure and responsive DID system.
*   **Seamless Interoperability:** The module is deeply integrated with our existing blockchain infrastructure, ensuring smooth communication and data exchange across the ecosystem. This also sets the stage for future integration with Verifiable Credentials (VCs).
*   **Enhanced Privacy & Control:** Empowers users with greater control over their digital identities, fostering self-sovereignty and reducing reliance on centralized identity providers.

### Option 3: Short & Punchy (Good for a changelog)

**feat: Decentralized Identity (DID) System Module (L3)**

*   Introduced a new module providing full Decentralized Identity (DID) system capabilities on our dedicated Layer 3 (L3) blockchain.
*   Includes DID creation, verification, and resolution, enabling self-sovereign identity.
*   Integrated for seamless interoperability with core blockchain infrastructure.

**Which one to choose?**

*   **Option 1:** Good balance for a general release note.
*   **Option 2:** Best if you need to provide more context, explain the "why," and highlight the value proposition. Ideal for a blog post or a more detailed announcement.
*   **Option 3:** Perfect for a quick changelog or a high-level summary where space is limited.

All options retain the core information while enhancing clarity and impact. I personally lean towards **Option 1** or **2** for a feature as significant as a DID system.
