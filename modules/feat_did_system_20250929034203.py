ðŸš€ Feature: Introducing Decentralized Identity (DID) System Module

We're excited to announce the launch of a brand new module, establishing a fully functional Decentralized Identity (DID) system on our dedicated Layer 3 (L3) blockchain!

**Key Highlights:**

*   **Foundation for Self-Sovereign Identity:** This module lays the groundwork for self-sovereign identity, empowering users with greater control over their digital identities and personal data.
*   **Comprehensive DID Lifecycle Management:**
    *   **DID Creation:** Users can now generate unique and cryptographically secure DIDs directly on our L3 blockchain.
    *   **DID Verification:** Robust mechanisms for verifying DIDs and associated credentials, ensuring trust and authenticity in interactions.
    *   **DID Resolution:** Efficient methods for resolving DIDs to their corresponding DID Documents, providing access to public keys and service endpoints.
*   **Seamless Ecosystem Integration:** Designed for maximum compatibility, the DID module is deeply integrated with our existing blockchain infrastructure, facilitating smooth interoperability with dApps and services across our ecosystem. This opens up new possibilities for secure, privacy-preserving interactions.

This advancement significantly enhances the utility and capabilities of our L3 blockchain, paving the way for a new generation of identity-centric applications.
