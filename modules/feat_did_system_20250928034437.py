This is a solid commit message! It follows the `type: subject` format and provides clear, concise body details.

Here are a few options, slightly refining or expanding on your initial message, playing with emphasis and detail, while maintaining best practices:

---

### Option 1 (Slightly more formal/expanded, but still concise)

```
feat: Implement Decentralized Identity (DID) system module

Introduces a new module for managing Decentralized Identities (DIDs) on a dedicated Layer 3 (L3) blockchain.
This module provides comprehensive functionalities for the DID lifecycle, including:
- DID creation
- Secure verification
- Efficient resolution

The implementation ensures seamless interoperability through robust integration with existing blockchain infrastructure, leveraging its security and scalability.
```

**Why this is good:**
*   More active verb in the subject (`Implement` vs. `Add new module for`).
*   Breaks out the functionalities with bullet points for readability.
*   Slightly elaborates on the "why" of integration (leveraging security/scalability).

---

### Option 2 (Focus on "Enabling" a capability)

```
feat: Enable Decentralized Identity (DID) on L3 blockchain

This commit introduces a new module to support a Decentralized Identity (DID) system.

Key features include:
- Deployment on a dedicated Layer 3 (L3) blockchain for optimized performance and isolation.
- Full lifecycle management for DIDs: creation, verification, and resolution.
- Robust integration with existing blockchain infrastructure to ensure seamless interoperability.

This lays the groundwork for self-sovereign identity solutions within our ecosystem.
```

**Why this is good:**
*   Subject emphasizes the new *capability* being enabled.
*   Uses "Key features" for a clear summary of the body.
*   Adds a sentence about the broader impact/goal ("lays the groundwork for self-sovereign identity").

---

### Option 3 (Closer to your original, with minor tweaks)

```
feat: Add Decentralized Identity (DID) system module

- Implemented a module for a decentralized identity (DID) system on a dedicated Layer 3 (L3) blockchain.
- The module provides core functionalities for DID creation, verification, and resolution.
- Integrated with existing blockchain infrastructure to ensure seamless interoperability and maximize platform utility.
```

**Why this is good:**
*   Keeps your original structure and wording very closely.
*   Slightly refines "includes functionalities" to "provides core functionalities" and adds a touch to the integration benefit.

---

### Which one to choose?

*   **Option 1:** Good for a detailed, clear, and professional tone.
*   **Option 2:** Excellent if you want to highlight the *impact* and *future possibilities* of the feature.
*   **Option 3:** A very solid, straightforward improvement on your original.

All options are strong and follow conventional commit message best practices. I personally lean towards **Option 1 or 2** as they add a bit more polish and context.
